## v1.0.0 - 2024-10-06

### Breaking changes

This release contains a lot of breaking changes

* Compare your published config and update it accordingly.
* ENV variables prefix is changed from `OT` to `OTEL` and some env variables are changed.
* Tracer has been completely refactored, manual traces must been updated with the new methods.

`Tracer::start`, `Tracer::measure` and `Tracer::measureAsync` has been removed and replaced with:

```php
Tracer::newSpan('name')->start(); // same as old start
Tracer::newSpan('name')->measure(callback); // same as old measure
Tracer::newSpan('name')->setSpanKind(SpanKind::KIND_PRODUCER)->measure(callback); // same as old measureAsync

```
`Tracer::recordExceptionToSpan` has been removed and exception should be recorded directly to span: `$span->recordException($exception)`

`Tracer::setRootSpan($span)` has been removed, it was only used to share traceId with log context. This has been replaced with `Tracer::updateLogContext()`

##### Logging

This release introduce a custom log channel for laravel `otlp` that allows to collect laravel logs with OpenTelemetry.
This is the injected `otlp` channel:

```php
// config/logging.php
'channels' => [
    // injected channel config, you can override it adding an `otlp` channel in your config
    'otlp' => [
        'driver' => 'monolog',
        'handler' => \Keepsuit\LaravelOpenTelemetry\Support\OpenTelemetryMonologHandler::class,
        'level' => 'debug',
    ]
]

```
